# Dactyl CC Keyboard
[WORK IN PROGRESS]

The 3d files can be found @ [Dactyl CC Github](https://github.com/mjohns/dactyl-cc)
I started by printing all the parts needed for Dactyl CC


Other parts needed:
* [PLA Filament](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08GCJR1QC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [1N4148 Diodes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07QDNC9YY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [TRRS cable](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07FFT6L12/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
* [TRRS connector](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07KYCC7RN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Teensy 4.0](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07W5J3WNH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [MCP23017 IO Expander](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MLSCLWY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [M3 Thread nut inserts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08YWXMC3D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [M3 flat head screws](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0819QXRBR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Keycaps](https://kbdfans.com/collections/dsa-profile/products/dsa-ergo-blank-keycaps)
* [30 Awg wire](https://www.amazon.co.uk/uxcell-Wrapping-Plated-DM-30-1000-Eletronic/dp/B07HFB2MX4/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=30%2Bawg%2Bwire&qid=1629043302&sr=8-6&th=1)

I bought these KBDFans keycaps and I had to alter the 1.5 keycaps a little to make them fit. I will most likely order the Kinesis original keycaps next time, just to keep the colour configuration on the mid row and also so I will not have to modify any of the keys.
